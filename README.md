## **Project Overview**

Sustain-a-byte is a web and mobile application designed to bridge the gap between food banks, potential donors, and the food insecure. The app enables users to see which food banks have and need specific food items, facilitating more efficient donations. By providing real-time information, we aim to streamline the donation process, ensuring that food banks are better stocked and that those in need can access food more easily.

### **Our Goal:**
- Empower food insecure individuals with knowledge of available food at nearby food banks.
- Simplify the donation process for businesses, consumers, and food banks.
- Enhance collaboration and community support through the donation ecosystem.
